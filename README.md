## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

I've read several news posts on different social media and new channels in the United States where people say 'black people commits the most crime in the United States'. I thought it would be best if data be the judge of that. 

I'm interested in finding the crime rate for all races in the United States from 1980 to 2019 using a data-centric approach. I believe that this will have me better informed than these posts by random users.
